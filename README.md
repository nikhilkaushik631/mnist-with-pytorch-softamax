# Softmax Classifier for MNIST Digit Classification

## Objective
The goal of this project is to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using a Softmax classifier implemented in PyTorch. This project serves as an introduction to fundamental classification techniques in deep learning, focusing on the Softmax function, which is commonly used for multi-class classification problems. By the end of this project, you will understand how to:
- Preprocess and load the MNIST dataset in PyTorch.
- Implement a single-layer neural network using the Softmax function for classification.
- Train the model using the cross-entropy loss function.
- Evaluate the model's performance using accuracy metrics on a test set.

This project will also give you a hands-on understanding of building simple machine learning models from scratch, using the PyTorch framework, one of the most popular deep learning libraries.

## Introduction
In this project, we will work with the **MNIST dataset**, which contains grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9). The objective is to create a model that can accurately classify these digits based on their pixel values. 

We will utilize a **Softmax classifier**, a simple but effective model for multi-class classification. The Softmax function turns the raw output of the neural network (logits) into a probability distribution, where each output node corresponds to the probability of the input image being a particular digit. This probability distribution helps us assign a label to each input image.

### Why Softmax Classifier?
The Softmax classifier is an extension of the logistic regression model, which is used for binary classification. In cases where there are more than two classes (like the digits 0-9 in this project), Softmax is particularly useful because it can handle multiple categories. Each image in the dataset is classified into one of 10 categories, and the Softmax function ensures that the sum of the predicted probabilities across these categories is equal to 1. This provides a more interpretable and robust way of dealing with multi-class classification.

### Why MNIST?
The MNIST dataset is widely regarded as the "Hello World" of deep learning. It provides an excellent starting point for learning image classification techniques since the images are small (28x28 pixels), grayscale, and relatively easy to work with. Despite its simplicity, MNIST classification forms the foundation for more advanced image classification tasks, making it an ideal starting point for beginners.

By the end of this project, you will have built a basic neural network from scratch, trained it using gradient descent, and tested its ability to classify unseen handwritten digits.

## Dataset
The MNIST database contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits. Each image is a 28x28 grayscale image representing digits from 0 to 9.

## Makeup Data
In this section, we preprocess the MNIST dataset, preparing the data for the Softmax classifier. The input features will be flattened into a vector of size 784 (28x28 pixels).

## Softmax Classifier
The core of this project is the Softmax classifier. Softmax is used in the output layer to predict the probability distribution of 10 classes (0-9). The classifier is defined using PyTorch.

## Model Setup
### Define Softmax, Criterion Function, and Optimizer
- **Softmax**: The single-layer neural network with the Softmax function to convert logits to probabilities.
- **Criterion Function**: The cross-entropy loss function is used to measure the difference between the predicted probabilities and the true labels.
- **Optimizer**: We use stochastic gradient descent (SGD) to optimize the model weights.

### Train the Model
The model will be trained on the MNIST training dataset. In this section, we will:
- Forward pass the input through the Softmax classifier.
- Calculate the loss using the criterion function.
- Update the model parameters using the optimizer.

## Result Analysis
After training, the model will be evaluated on the test dataset. We will analyze the results by calculating the accuracy of the Softmax classifier on the MNIST digits.
